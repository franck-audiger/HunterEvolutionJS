  "PortIntro.IntroEvt.dialogue1": "Hey, Mito! We didn’t see you with the little one this morning.",
  "PortIntro.IntroEvt.dialogue2": "He's not sick, I hope?",
  "PortIntro.IntroEvt.dialogue3": "No… he left very early. He went to the lagoon.",
  "PortIntro.IntroEvt.dialogue4": "Again? That's the third time this week.",
  "PortIntro.IntroEvt.dialogue5": "Is he still chasing that Pond Master?",
  "PortIntro.IntroEvt.dialogue6": "Yes. It’s… his condition.",
  "PortIntro.IntroEvt.dialogue7": "I told him I wouldn’t sign for the Hunter Exam until he caught it.",
  "PortIntro.IntroEvt.dialogue8": "And do you think he can?",
  "PortIntro.IntroEvt.dialogue9": "Even the village adults never succeeded in bringing that beast back.",
  "PortIntro.IntroEvt.dialogue10": "I know… But he didn’t beg me. He just looked me in the eyes…and said he would make it. He has the same look as Ging, sometimes.",
  "PortIntro.IntroEvt.dialogue11": "You mean the same stubbornness.",
  "PortIntro.IntroEvt.dialogue12": "It’s not stubbornness. It’s… something else.",
  "PortIntro.IntroEvt.dialogue13": "Something I can’t take away from him, even if I wanted to.",
  "PortIntro.IntroEvt.dialogue14": "So it seems the boy is about to take flight.",
  "PortIntro.IntroEvt.dialogue15": "Not yet!",
  "PortIntro.IntroEvt.dialogue16": "But if he ever returns with that creature… then yes. I’ll have no excuse to hold him back.",
  "Lagon.IntroLagon.dialogue1": "…He tugged on the line again, but not enough to hook it. It's clever.",
  "Lagon.IntroLagon.dialogue2": "I know you're there… I feel your presence underwater.",
  "Lagon.IntroLagon.dialogue3": "Mito said I had to catch you if I wanted to leave… that it was my proof.",
  "Lagon.IntroLagon.dialogue4": "It's not just a fish. It’s a challenge. As if the island itself told me: “Show me if you’re worthy.”",
  "Lagon.IntroLagon.dialogue5": "Dad passed through here too, right? He had to face this... before becoming a Hunter.",
  "Lagon.IntroLagon.dialogue6": "I want to understand why he left. Why he chose this… instead of staying.",
  "Lagon.IntroLagon.dialogue7": "Maybe if I pass this trial…I’ll understand a little better.",
  "Lagon.IntroLagon.dialogue8": "…Another movement. It's coming back.",
  "Lagon.IntroLagon.dialogue9": "Ahh there it is!!!",
  "PortCapture.EV001.dialogue1": "He… he did it… That kid actually did it…",
  "PortCapture.EV001.dialogue2": "And he's barely 12 years old…",
  "PortCapture.EV001.dialogue3": "Last time I saw that beast out of water… was twenty years ago.",
  "PortCapture.EV001.dialogue4": "Twenty years?!",
  "PortCapture.EV001.dialogue5": "It was Ging. He brought it right here… like his son today.",
  "PortCapture.EV001.dialogue6": "Gon…",
  "PortCapture.EV001.dialogue7": "So… will you sign?",
  "PortCapture.EV001.dialogue8": "You have the same look he had.",
  "PortCapture.EV001.dialogue9": "It’s not just a catch. It’s a rite. A passage.",
  "PortCapture.EV001.dialogue10": "All that’s missing is the wind to carry it away.",
  "PortCapture.EV001.dialogue11": "Go… become who you want to become.",
  "PortCapture.EV001.dialogue12": "He's not a kid anymore. Not after that.",
  "MaisonMitoIntro.Envt.dialogue1": "You know Mito. This reminds me of something. Ging also caught the Pond Master at twelve.",
  "MaisonMitoIntro.Envt.dialogue2": "Yes, I remember… It was the same look in his eyes.",
  "MaisonMitoIntro.Envt.dialogue3": "Determination, impatience... and that thirst for freedom.",
  "MaisonMitoIntro.Envt.dialogue4": "And now it's Gon. As if fate was playing the same scene again…",
  "MaisonMitoIntro.Envt.dialogue5": "The only difference is this time... my heart isn’t ready to let him go without saying anything.",
  "MaisonMitoEtageIntro.Envt.dialogue1": "You're already packing…",
  "MaisonMitoEtageIntro.Envt.dialogue2": "I’m leaving tomorrow morning. I’ve prepared everything.",
  "MaisonMitoEtageIntro.Envt.dialogue3": "Gon… I need to tell you something.",
  "MaisonMitoEtageIntro.Envt.dialogue4": "Your father… Ging… He left you here to become a Hunter.",
  "MaisonMitoEtageIntro.Envt.dialogue5": "He never tried to come back. No letters. No visits.",
  "MaisonMitoEtageIntro.Envt.dialogue6": "And yet… he became one of the best.",
  "MaisonMitoEtageIntro.Envt.dialogue7": "He abandoned me…",
  "MaisonMitoEtageIntro.Envt.dialogue8": "Why go so far?",
  "MaisonMitoEtageIntro.Envt.dialogue9": "It must be amazing!",
  "MaisonMitoEtageIntro.Envt.dialogue10": "I can’t help thinking he abandoned me.",
  "MaisonMitoEtageIntro.Envt.dialogue11": "I was just a baby. He could have stayed…",
  "MaisonMitoEtageIntro.Envt.dialogue12": "I need to know the truth!",
  "MaisonMitoEtageIntro.Envt.dialogue13": "You're just like your father… You can’t be stopped.",
  "IleBaleine-MitoHouse.Envt.dialogue1": "Here. It's for the road.",
  "IleBaleine-MitoHouse.Envt.dialogue2": "It's… onigiri?",
  "IleBaleine-MitoHouse.Envt.dialogue3": "Yes. You might need them. Not sure if the boats serve fresh fish every day.",
  "IleBaleine-MitoHouse.Envt.dialogue4": "Thanks… I’ll keep them. Promise.",
  "IleBaleine-MitoHouse.Envt.dialogue5": "You're sure of yourself, huh…",
  "IleBaleine-MitoHouse.Envt.dialogue6": "Yes!",
  "IleBaleine-MitoHouse.Envt.dialogue7": "Then go. But don’t forget where you come from.",
  "IleBaleine-MitoHouse.Pecheur.dialogue1": "Gon! Just one minute!",
  "IleBaleine-MitoHouse.Pecheur.dialogue2": "What's happening?",
  "IleBaleine-MitoHouse.Pecheur.dialogue3": "One of the port guys lost a rare bait. He put it aside for the Sea Exam.",
  "IleBaleine-MitoHouse.Pecheur.dialogue4": "An animal stole it and ran off toward the coastal forest. We don’t have time to follow.",
  "IleBaleine-MitoHouse.Pecheur.dialogue5": "Can you go? There's a reward waiting.",
  "IleBaleine-MitoHouse.Pecheur.dialogue6": "Want to become a Hunter? Start there.",
  "IleBaleine-MitoHouse.Pecheur.dialogue7": "Alright. I’ll find it!",
  "IleBaleine-MitoHouse.Pecheur.dialogue8": "Find me at the port once you’ve got it!",
  "IleBaleine-Map1.EVT001.dialogue1": "Did you know freshwater catfish sing when it storms?",
  "IleBaleine-Map1.EVT001.dialogue2": "Well, maybe it’s just in my head… but I still listen.",
  "IleBaleine-Map1.Envt.dialogue1": "Be careful from here on — forest animals might attack you.",
  "IleBaleine-Map1.Envt.dialogue2": "Ahh there!! A boar is charging us!",
  "IleBaleine-Map1.Envt.dialogue3": "Glad you were here! I’ll wait for you at the Port.",
  "Port.PecheurQuete.dialogue1": "Did you find the bait??",
  "Port.PecheurQuete.dialogue2": "Yes! I got it. Here it is!",
  "Port.PecheurQuete.dialogue3": "Ohhh amazing, work can resume!",
  "Port.PecheurQuete.dialogue4": "Ehhh no, not yet...",
  "Port.PecheurQuete.dialogue5": "Are you kidding me!!",
  "Port.PecheurQuete.dialogue6": "Try to do it quickly… We’re stuck here without…",
  "Port.PecheurQuete.dialogue7": "Ahhh thanks for finding that bait!",
  "Port.EV005.dialogue1": "Hmmm... If you find this bait, you’ll do more than help my old friend…",
  "Port.EV005.dialogue2": "You’ll bring hope back to the entire port. Go on, kid.",
  "Port.EV005.dialogue3": "You did it.. Haha! I knew it! My grumpy old friend will have to buy you a drink now!",
  "Port.EV007.dialogue1": "Hehehe… The leaves speak… they told me a legendary bait disappeared… or was it a banana?",
  "Port.EV007.dialogue2": "Ah, whatever. Find it, boy. Or the port will sink!",
  "Port.EV007.dialogue3": "Heh… balance is restored… The gorillas are singing again, the worms are dancing, and you...",
  "Port.EV007.dialogue4": "You shone, young light-fisher!",
  "Port.EV006.dialogue1": "Well! As long as you haven’t found the bait, no one will bite. Not me either.",
  "Port.EV006.dialogue2": "Well done, kid. With that bait, I feel they’ll bite like never before. I owe you a line, haha!",
  "Port.EV009.dialogue1": "I can’t rebuild anything while beasts roam.",
  "Port.EV009.dialogue2": "And without the bait... The fishermen complain... well, the routine.",
  "Port.EV009.dialogue3": "Thanks kid. Thanks to you, the port breathes again.",
  "Port.EV009.dialogue4": "If you need a raft or two, you know where to find me.",
  "Port.EV010.dialogue1": "I saw monkeys running off with something shiny, all excited…",
  "Port.EV010.dialogue2": "I hope you’re not after that, too.",
  "Port.EV010.dialogue3": "You got it? Heh, I knew you had resource in you. This port will talk about you for a long time.",
  "Port.Bateau.dialogue1": "The boat is ready to set sail. Want to board now?",
  "Port.Bateau.dialogue2": "Yes, I’m ready",
  "Port.Bateau.dialogue3": "No, not yet",
  "IleBaleine-ForetCotiere2.EV002.dialogue1": "Hmm… another lost soul among the pines and mist?",
  "IleBaleine-ForetCotiere2.EV002.dialogue2": "Do you want a roof? An onigiri? Or just chat with an old tree like me?",
  "IleBaleine-ForetCotiere2.EV002.dialogue3": "Sleep",
  "IleBaleine-ForetCotiere2.EV002.dialogue4": "Onigiri",
  "IleBaleine-ForetCotiere2.EV002.dialogue5": "I’d like to sleep a bit, please.",
  "IleBaleine-ForetCotiere2.EV002.dialogue6": "Perfect kid, rest well…",
  "IleBaleine-ForetCotiere2.EV002.dialogue7": "I slept well!",
  "IleBaleine-ForetCotiere2.EV002.dialogue8": "Looks like you don’t have enough to pay for lodging, kid!",
  "IleBaleine-ForetCotiere2.EV002.dialogue9": "I’d like something to eat, please.",
  "IleBaleine-ForetCotiere2.EV002.dialogue10": "Perfect kid, here is what you deserve…",
  "IleBaleine-ForetCotiere2.EV002.dialogue11": "Thank you!",
  "IleBaleine-ForetCotiere2.EV002.dialogue12": "Looks like you don’t have enough to pay for that, kid!",
  "IleBaleine-ForetCotiere2.EV002.dialogue13": "I just wanted to talk a little.",
  "IleBaleine-ForetCotiere2.EV002.dialogue14": "Silence is rare here, especially these days.",
  "IleBaleine-ForetCotiere2.EV002.dialogue15": "The monkeys are restless. Not the “playful” kind, no… more like “plots in the foliage.”",
  "IleBaleine-ForetCotiere2.EV002.dialogue16": "And if the foliage gorilla comes out of its den at this hour, it’s not to smell the flowers.",
  "IleBaleine-ForetCotiere3.EVT-Combat.dialogue1": "Ahh it looks like I found it!",
  "IleBaleine-ForetCotiere3.EVT-Combat.dialogue2": "All I have to do is bring back the bait!",
